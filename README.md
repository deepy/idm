This project is a Django web application that provides identity management tools for basic LDAPs.  The initial capabilities were developed for self-service password reset and password recovery.  One of the primary purposes of this project was to learn both python (v2.x) and the Django web framework.  By no means should this project be regarded as developed with "best practices."  As time marches on, this project may or may not be refactored as my knowledge and experience evolve (buyer beware!).
